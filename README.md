This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

- I choose daisyui beacaus it's handy to have small components, and we can still customize it with tailwind if we need
- I would use react-hook-form to handle the forms, especially the error and success state
- I could add some unit test to test that the drawer is well displayed
